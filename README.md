### Hi there 👋

I'm an experienced Fullstack Engineer who is deeply passionate about the digital landscape of the web. While my professional journey often finds me focusing on the Frontend, I'm equally immersed in Backend development. Javascript holds a special place in my heart, with its dynamic ecosystem bridging both browser and Nodejs platforms.

While tools like React, Vue, or Svelte offer incredible advantages for building robust and maintainable Frontend software, two decades in the industry have instilled in me a principle of adaptability. Evolution is the nature of our field. With this understanding, I've embraced a Framework-agnostic approach, prioritizing core logic and flexibility over any particular tool.

Beyond web development, my enthusiasm also reaches into the world of Machine Learning, with a particular interest in Deep Learning and Deep Reinforcement Learning. This isn't merely a hobby for me; I've been a devoted practitioner and an avid researcher in these fields. Countless hours have been invested in learning, experimenting, and pushing boundaries with personal projects—a journey well documented on my GitHub. This exploration has also introduced me to the Python language, which I've come to admire greatly.

Recently, I've been navigating the exciting world of Web 3. The idea of decentralization resonates deeply with me, and I'm actively transitioning from traditional web2 paradigms to the innovative domain of web3. A significant portion of my time is dedicated to mastering Solidity and delving into the vast ecosystem of decentralized apps on the Ethereum network.
