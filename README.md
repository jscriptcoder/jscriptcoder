### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I'm a Frontend Engineer. I do Frontend for a living, but my real passion is writing software in general, so I see myself more as a Software Engineer. I like though writing software for the web, and I tend to stay close to it, building not only Frontend but also Backend. I love Javascript language and all the ecosystem around it. Big fan of both Browser and Nodejs platforms. 

I'm not very enthusiastic about big libraries or frameworks such as React, Angular, Vue, etc... They're great tools to build scalable and maintanable Frontend software, bringing tons of benefits to the development, but over 15 years writing Frontend apps have taught me something: do not get too attach to them, because either they will evolve, or a new one will come out. This has forced me to adopt a strategy of Framework-agnosticsm: move outside as much logic as possible.

I'm extremelly passionate about Machine Learning, specially Deep Learning and Deep Reinforcement Learning. And this is not just a passion, I'm a practitioner and sort of a researcher in such topics. I spend tons of hours not only learning, but also practicing, working on personal projects. Github is my witness. It knows how many projects and researches I've worked on, and keeps track of it. This passion has led me to Python language, which I ended up quite fond of.

In my ideal world, I'm a Fullstack Software Developer building AI systems for the web.
