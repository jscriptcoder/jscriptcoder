### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I'm a seasoned Fullstack Engineer with a deep affection for the digital canvas of the web. While my professional journey often finds me focusing on the Frontend, I'm equally engrossed in Backend development. Javascript holds a special place in my heart, with its dynamic ecosystem bridging both browser and Nodejs platforms.

While tools like React, Vue, or Svelte offer incredible advantages for building robust and maintainable Frontend software, two decades in the industry have instilled in me a principle of adaptability. Evolution is the nature of our field. With this understanding, I've embraced a Framework-agnostic approach, prioritizing core logic and flexibility over any particular tool.

Beyond web development, my passion extends to the realm of Machine Learning, with a particular interest in Deep Learning and Deep Reinforcement Learning. This isn't merely a hobby for me; I've been a devoted practitioner and an avid researcher in these fields. Countless hours have been invested in learning, experimenting, and pushing boundaries with personal projectsâ€”a journey well documented on my GitHub. This exploration has also introduced me to the Python language, which I've come to admire greatly.

Recently, I've been navigating the exciting world of Web 3.0. The idea of decentralization resonates deeply with me, and I'm actively transitioning from traditional web2 paradigms to the innovative realm of web3, with its blockchain-based smart contracts. A significant portion of my time is dedicated to mastering Solidity and delving into the vast ecosystem of decentralized apps on the Ethereum network.
