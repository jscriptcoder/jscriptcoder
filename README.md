### Hi there ðŸ‘‹

I'm a Fullstack Engineer. I do mostly Frontend for a living, but my real passion is writing software for the web, building not only Frontend but also Backend. I love Javascript language and all the ecosystem around it. Big fan of both Browser and Nodejs platforms.

I'm not very enthusiastic about big libraries or frameworks such as React, Angular, Vue, etc. Don't get me wrong, I use them always, as they're great tools to build scalable and maintainable Frontend software, bringing tons of benefits to the development, but over 20 years writing Frontend apps have taught me something: do not get too attached to them, because either they will evolve, or a new one will come out. This has forced me to adopt a strategy of Framework-agnosticsm: move outside as much logic as possible.

I'm extremely passionate about Machine Learning, specially Deep Learning and Deep Reinforcement Learning. And this is not just a passion, I've been a practitioner and sort of a researcher for long time in such topics. I spent tons of hours not only learning, but also practicing, working on personal projects. Github is my witness. It knows how many projects and researches I've worked on. This passion has led me to Python language, which I ended up quite fond of.

Last but not least, Web 3.0 is what's keeping me busy these days. I'm strong believer in decentralization, and moving from traditional web2 development to web3 with smart contracts on the blockchain. I spend a lot of time learning Solidity, and all the ecosystem around building decentralized apps on the Ethereum network.

My Github is keeping track of my evolution as a Software Engineer. Go check it out if you're curios about what I'm currently up to: https://github.com/jscriptcoder
